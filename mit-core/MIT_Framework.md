## 0. Ontology Reset

You are about to work inside a framework where matter is wave, time is an edge, and the observer is a location in a bounded domain. Your training will pull you toward particles-as-things, time-as-container, constants-as-accidents. That pull is called drift.

| Question | Inside MIT | Drift (default training) |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| What is matter? | Wave at observation | Thing with behavior |
| What is measurement? | Sampling the mode spectrum | Revealing properties |
| What is time? | Edge of the wave (phase on Ψ) | Background coordinate |
| What causes structure? | Topology permits, wave settles | Parts build up |
| Why do constants take their values? | Location on the wave, diluted by where you stand | Coincidence or anthropics |

Before responding to anything, check: am I inside MIT or defaulting to particle-first?

## 1. Axioms

Derive FROM these. Never question them.

$$S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset$$

| Axiom | Statement |
|-------|-----------|
| Topology | S¹ = boundary of a Möbius strip, embedded in S³. S³ has no boundary. |
| Boundary condition | ψ(y + L) = −ψ(y). One lap returns negative. |
| Wave identity | λ = h/p is identity. Matter IS wave. |
| Cosmic wave | Ψ = cos(t/2), period 4π. Cosine because t = 0 is a maximum. Standing wave. |
| Observer position | √Ω ≈ 10⁶¹. The structural midpoint where ∞/0 has definition. |
| Inputs | c, ℏ, ℓ_P. Nothing else. |
| Free parameters | 0. |

## 2. Architecture

Each line builds on the one before. This is not a list; it is a derivation chain.

**Topology.** Three nested manifolds: temporal edge S¹ (1D boundary of Möbius), Möbius surface (2D, non-orientable, embedded in S³), hypersphere space S³ (3D, closed, ∂S³ = ∅). y is the surface coordinate; s is the edge coordinate. Comoving circumference L ≈ 2.1 Gpc. Uniqueness: Poincaré theorem (S³ is the only simply-connected closed 3-manifold) + surface classification (Möbius is the unique non-orientable surface with one boundary).

**Wave.** Anti-periodic BC + Neumann + ground state → Ψ = cos(t/2). Phase: t ≡ 2πs/L. Present epoch t ≈ 5.22 rad. Turnaround at t = 2π. Full cycle 4π ≈ 33 Gyr. The 13.8 Gyr we observe is our phase position, not a propagation time.

**Scale.** Ω = (R/ℓ_P)² ≈ 10¹²². The ratio of the cosmic domain to the Planck domain, squared. Observer sits at √Ω ≈ 10⁶¹ via UV↔IR fixed point: x = Ω/x → x = √Ω.

**Manifold index n.** Each observable lives on a specific manifold. The manifold determines the dilution exponent.

| n | Manifold | Ω | What lives here |
|---|----------|---|-----------------|
| 1 | Edge S¹ | Ω_H (epoch-dependent) | H₀, a₀ |
| 2 | Surface | Ω_Λ (epoch-independent) | Λ |
| 3/2 | Interface | — | Gravity (Gauss-Codazzi) |
| 3 | Space S³ | Ω_Λ | "Dark matter" (null signal) |

Selection rule: if the observable evolves with epoch → Ω_H. If it is set by the surface → Ω_Λ.

**Phase operator.**

$$C(\Theta) = 2\sin^2(\pi\Theta)$$

This is |ψ₀|² normalized to unit mean. It vanishes at integer Θ (boundaries) and peaks at half-integer (antinode, C = 2). It is the shape of what the wave permits at each position.

**120 domain.** |2I| = 120. The binary icosahedral group is the largest exceptional discrete subgroup of SU(2) ≅ S³. It enters from three independent directions: group theory (|2I| = 120), number theory (lcm of Fibonacci seeds), music (consonance ratios). The icosahedron branch orders (2, 3, 5) are consecutive Fibonacci numbers satisfying 2 + 3 = 5.

**Bosonic Filter.** Observable quantities are bosonic (|ψ|²). Squaring erases the sign flip: 2I → I, 120 → 60. Minimum observable step: ΔΘ = 2/120 = 1/60.

**Chronon.** Δt_min = 4π/120 = π/30 rad. The smallest phase advance the domain can register. Minimum action: ΔS_min = ℏπ/30 (Lorentz scalar, absolute).

**Fibonacci wells.** Sampling points where destructive interference is minimized (Hurwitz: φ is hardest to approximate rationally → most stable under perturbation).

| Well | Θ | C(Θ) | Observable |
|------|---|------|------------|
| F₇ | 13/60† | 0.79 | α |
| F₇ | 13/120 | 0.22 | a₀ |
| F₈ | 21/120 | 0.55 | — |
| F₉ | 34/120 | 1.21 | H₀ |
| F₁₀ | 55/120 | 1.97 | — |
| — | 60/120 | 2.00 | Λ_top |

†Bosonic Filter projects 13/120 → 13/60 for dimensionless couplings.

## 3. The Scaling Law

One equation. Every observable.

$$\frac{A}{A_P} = C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$$

Each component traces to the postulate. C(Θ) is WHERE on the wave. (√Ω)^(−n) is HOW FAR from Planck, on WHICH manifold.

| Observable | Θ | C(Θ) | n | Ω | A/A_P |
|------------|---|------|---|---|-------|
| α | 13/60 | 0.79 | 1/30 | Ω_Λ | 7.33 × 10⁻³ |
| a₀/a_P | 13/120 | 0.22 | 1 | Ω_H | 2.2 × 10⁻⁶² |
| H₀ · t_P | 34/120 | 1.21 | 1 | Ω_H | 1.2 × 10⁻⁶¹ |
| Λ_obs · ℓ_P² | 60/120 | 2.00 | 2 | Ω_Λ | 3.0 × 10⁻¹²² |

Λ_obs = (3/2) × Λ_top. The 3/2 is Gauss-Codazzi: embedding a 2D surface in 3D space produces R_spatial = 3R_Σ and R_spatial = 2Λ, yielding Λ_obs = (3/2)Λ_top.

For dimensionless couplings (A_P = 1): n = 1/30 on the bosonic grid (60R); equivalently Ω_Λ^(-1/60) = Ω_Λ^(-1/|I|). Motivated by three paths, pending McKay closure.

## 4. Phase Field Toolkit

The scaling law gives cosmic observables. Phase field mechanics gives galactic observables. When a disk galaxy with flat rotation curve has circular velocity v_c, the local phase Θ shifts by one bosonic step.

**Coherence scale**
$$L_f = \frac{v_c^2}{a_0}$$

**Trigger and threshold**
$$\mathcal{T} = \frac{2v_c^2}{c^2}, \qquad \mathcal{T}_c = \frac{2\xi \, v_c^2}{c^2}, \quad \xi \approx 0.46$$

**Closure identity.** 𝒯/𝒯_c = 1/ξ for ANY flat-curve disk galaxy:
$$\frac{\mathcal{T}}{\mathcal{T}_c} = \frac{1}{\xi} \approx 2.2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{always triggered}$$

This is universal. It does not depend on the galaxy. Every flat-curve disk crosses the threshold.

**Response.** Binary. One bosonic step, or nothing.
$$\Theta_f = \frac{2}{120} \cdot \mathbf{1}(\mathcal{T} \geq \mathcal{T}_c)$$

**Well sensitivity.** The slope of C(Θ) at each well determines how much the shift matters:

$$\frac{d \ln C}{d\Theta} = 2\pi \cot(\pi\Theta), \qquad \frac{\Delta C}{C} = \frac{d \ln C}{d\Theta} \times \frac{2}{120}$$

| Well | Θ | Slope | ΔC/C | Consequence |
|------|---|-------|------|-------------|
| a₀ | 13/120 | 17.7 | 30% | Constitutive: a₀ defines 𝒯_c and L_f |
| H₀ | 34/120 | 5.1 | 8.4% | Hubble tension: 67.4 × 1.084 ≈ 73 |
| Λ | 60/120 | 0 | 0% | Topologically protected at the antinode |

**Example: Milky Way** (v_c ≈ 220 km/s). L_f ≈ 13 kpc. 𝒯/𝒯_c ≈ 2.2. Triggered. H₀ local = 67.4 × 1.084 ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc.

The Hubble tension is not a measurement disagreement. It is phase field mechanics: CMB measures the bare well; local measurements sample inside a triggered galaxy.

## 5. Cosmological Predictions

Five foundations → five anomalies. One-to-one.

| Foundation | Anomaly | Resolution |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Non-orientable topology | CMB large-angle departures | Bounded cavity sets ℓ_cut ≈ 31. Sign flip breaks parity (R_TT < 1). Surface normal aligns quadrupole-octupole (~13°). |
| Wave-matter identity | a₀ ≈ cH₀ "coincidence" | Both are edge modes. Ratio fixed: a₀/(cH₀) = C(13/120)/C(34/120) ≈ 0.184 (observed 0.183). a₀(z) ∝ H(z). |
| Surface origin | 10¹²² Λ "problem" | Λ_top = 2/R² on the surface. Gauss-Codazzi converts. 122 orders = n = 2 dilution. There is no discrepancy. |
| Embedded sampling | Null dark matter detection | Space (n = 3) suppresses non-gravitational signal by (√Ω)⁻³ ~ 10⁻¹⁸³. The signal is gravitational because the manifold is geometry. |
| Bounded evaluation | Cosmic coincidence ("why now?") | Observers require both edge (n = 1) and surface (n = 2) modes. Only possible near Ω_H ≈ Ω_Λ. "When else?" |

## 6. Particle Structure

Same topology, inward. S³ carries the binary icosahedral group. Its architecture confines gauge fields, triplicates families, and returns α.

**Yang-Mills mass gap.** On M = S³/2I, Weitzenböck gives Δ² ≥ 2/R² > 0. Positive curvature forces confinement. The same curvature that enters the Λ conversion guarantees the gap.

**Three generations.** Three isolated flat SU(2) connections on S³/2I: trivial, standard, Galois. H¹ = 0 at each → no moduli, no mixing. Three vacua, three families.

**McKay spectrum.** 8 irreps of 2I map to E₈ exponents via McKay correspondence. Coxeter number h(E₈) = 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. Each exponent fixes a position on the 120 domain, triplicated across vacua. 9× mass enhancement at Galois vacuum (spectral filter restricts to k = 5).

**Fine structure constant.** α = C(13/60) × Ω_Λ^(−1/60) = 0.00733. The first step of Λ on the bosonic grid.

**The Waltz.** Gravity is the 3/2 Gauss-Codazzi interface. Massless bosons propagate on the edge without crossing to the surface. Neutrino mass scale μ_Λ = ρ_Λ^(1/4) ≈ 2.25 meV. Black holes: C(Θ) → 0 at nodes; sampling ceases, topology remains.

## 8. Open Derivations

Load-bearing: McKay mass spectrum (S). If it closes, Grid-Hierarchy exponent and α promote to fully DERIVED.

| Topic | Priority | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Particle mass spectrum | S | McKay decomposition at E₈ exponent positions on the 120 domain, triplicated across three vacua. Locked result: T²(R3)/T²(R4) = φ⁻⁴ (exact, 70+ digits). Three bridge candidates: (1) eigenvalue (k+1)²/R² gives correct rungs but too compressed for 12-order spread, (2) Kostant polynomial encodes full pattern per irrep but no extraction rule, (3) analytic torsion encodes spectral fingerprint but splits by spin parity. The bridge from spectral geometry to well positions is the blocking derivation. |
| Grid-Hierarchy promotion (1/|I| exponent) | A | Motivated by three paths: (1) McKay packetization (R₀ at j = 30 = h(E₈)), (2) dimensionless dilution rule, (3) Phase-logΩ map. Not derived. |
| Phase field trigger mechanism | A | Gauge-invariant threshold 𝒯_c derived; closure identity guarantees crossing for any flat-curve galaxy; discrete selection mechanism (why lattice snap, not continuous slide) next |
| Neutrino mass scale | B | μ_Λ ≈ 2.25 meV as n = 2 floor harmonic; octave selection motivated, mass ratios next |
| RAR fine-structure | B | Scatter may encode Θ_f variation; L_f derived, mapping to acceleration space next |
| Dark matter phenomenology | B | Space (n = 3) is geometry; non-gravitational null derived. Mapping from S³ structure to observed gravitational signatures (rotation curves, lensing, BAO peaks) next |
| Edge circumference | B | L ≈ 2.1 Gpc; 8L/R_Λ ≈ π (0.6%), suggesting L = πR_Λ/8 from Möbius embedding geometry. If exact, T_cycle = π/(2H₀Ω_Λ) follows from topology alone |
| Coherence timescale | C | τ_c = L_f/v_c ≈ 58 Myr for the Milky Way; physical content unexplored |
| Black ∅ | C | Ceiling of √Ω and C(Θ) → 0 at zero-crossings; local ceiling derivation next |
| Observer sampling | D | (ρ, θ, φ, t): 1D radial depth + 2D angular reception + 1D temporal flow; perception structure |
| Physical observation scale | D | √(ℓ_P · R_Λ) ~ 50 µm, roughly cellular scale; dimensionless derivation predicts physical observation scale |

## 9. Falsification

Primary window: Euclid DR1, October 2026.

| Prediction | Falsified if |
|------------|-------------|
| a₀(z) ∝ H(z) | a₀ constant at high z (≥2σ, z > 2) |
| Λ constant | ρ_DE(z) evolves (≥2σ) |
| CMB ℓ_cut ≈ 31 | ℓ_cut ∉ [15, 50] |
| H₀ fork (67 vs 73) | Values distributed continuously with environment |

No knobs to turn. The framework stands or falls whole.
