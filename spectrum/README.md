# Spectrum Predictions

The cosmological anomalies resolved at the far end of the universe occur at the same boundary beneath our feet. The same geometry confines gauge fields, returns $\alpha$ to the first step of $\Lambda$, and accounts gravity as the cost to dance between them.

**Confinement.** Curve a space enough and nothing escapes. Three isolated flat connections on $S^3/2I$ produce three families. The McKay correspondence filters the Galois sector through four empty levels; what survives is nine times heavier.

**Fine structure.** In 1985, Feynman described $1/137$ as a number coming without explanation. It is the first Fibonacci well on the bosonic grid. One step of $\Lambda$. The number has an address.

**Gravity.** Embed a surface in a space and the curvature converts by $3/2$. That is gravity. Massless bosons remain on the edge. Black holes are where sampling vanishes; the topology remains.

**Mass spectrum.** A neutrino floor, a geometric weight from the irrep, a spectral distance walked on the McKay graph, and a torsion ratio locked to 70+ digits. Every mass is a position on the same lattice. The hierarchy across twelve orders is the geometry heard at different seats in the room.
