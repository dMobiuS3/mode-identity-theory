# Spectrum Predictions

Five anomalies resolved from the boundary outward. Inverting the question inward, the same geometry confines gauge fields, returns $\alpha$ to the first step of Λ, and accounts gravity as the cost to dance between them.

**Confinement.** Positive curvature on $S^3/2I$ forces a mass gap. Three isolated flat connections produce three particle generations. The McKay correspondence filters the Galois sector through four empty levels, yielding a ninefold enhancement. [Yang-Mills](yang-mills.md): three vacua, three families. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18463584)

**Fine structure.** $\alpha = C(13/60) \times \Omega_\Lambda^{-1/60}$ places the electromagnetic coupling at the first Fibonacci well on the bosonic grid. One step of Λ on the 60R-domain. [Fine Structure](fine-structure.md): 0.5% accuracy. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18484780)

**The dance.** Gravity is the 3/2 Gauss-Codazzi interface between continuous space and discrete surface. Masslessness is edge-only propagation. The neutrino floor sits at $\mu_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda^{1/4} \approx 2.25$ meV. Black holes are nodes where sampling amplitude vanishes. [The Waltz](the-waltz.md): General Relativity is the score; 3/2 is the time signature. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18176445)

**Mass spectrum.** 24 predictions from four locked factors: $m(\rho,\sigma) = \mu_\Lambda \times C_{\text{geom}}(\rho) \times (\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})^{\text{dist}/30} \times T^2(\rho \otimes \sigma)$. [Mass Spectrum](mass-spectrum.md): 10/12 SM fermions within x3, electron/up/muon within 6%. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18603975)
