# Mode Identity Theory

Matter is wave, sampled. A single topological postulate produces one scaling law. It derives the constants of the universe: $\Lambda$, $H_0$, $a_0$, and $\alpha$ across 122 orders of magnitude. The topology determines boundary conditions, selects the cosmic wave $\Psi$, fixes the observer position $\sqrt{\Omega}$, and generates a discrete phase structure native to $S^3$.

Five cosmological anomalies map one-to-one to five foundations. The framework produces the $3/2$ Gauss-Codazzi gravitational embedding interface. At the particle scale, the same topology confines gauge fields; three particle generations follow from three isolated vacua.

## Five Foundations

| Foundation | Statement |
|---|---|
| Wave-matter identity | $\lambda = h/p$ is identity. Matter is wave, sampled. |
| Surface origin | Time is phase on the boundary of a 2D manifold. |
| Topology | $\psi(y + L) = -\psi(y)$. A field traversing the manifold returns to minus itself. |
| Bounded evaluation | $R_H/\ell_P$ has definition at the limit $\infty/0$. The observer is the structural midpoint of the bounded domain. |
| Embedded sampling | The observable's character selects the manifold ($n = 1, 2, 3$). Dimension follows the measurement. |

## The Engine

Mode Identity Theory is built upon a specific order of operation. Each step depends on the one before, and nothing later in the sequence exists independently from what came prior:

Topology sets what is possible → Embedding defines the structure → The Cosmic Wave expresses the boundary → Time is phase of the wave → Sampling resolves position in the domain → Meaning arises only after realization

## The Nested Topology

The topology had only one choice. The temporal edge bounds the Möbius surface embedded in hypersphere space; the space has no boundary.

$$S^1 = \partial(\text{Mobius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset$$

### The Temporal Edge $S^1$

The 1D boundary of the Möbius surface is the edge with comoving circumference $L \approx 2.1$ Gpc. Orientation reverses after one lap, requiring two for return. The full cycle is $4\pi$ in phase. The edge inherits the anti-periodic boundary condition.

### The Möbius Surface

The 2D non-orientable manifold bounded by the edge. Let $y$ denote the coordinate along the twisted direction. The Möbius $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy admits two boundary condition sectors: periodic $\psi(y+L) = +\psi(y)$ and anti-periodic $\psi(y+L) = -\psi(y)$. The anti-periodic sector is selected by observation; matter is fermionic. Fields in the selected sector satisfy:

$$\psi(y + L) = -\psi(y)$$

Along the twisted direction, the eigenproblem is $-\partial_y^2 \psi = \lambda \psi$. The ansatz $\psi \sim e^{iky}$ under the boundary condition requires:

$$e^{ikL} = -1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad kL = (2m + 1)\pi$$

Defining $\nu \equiv kL/(2\pi)$, then $kL = (2m+1)\pi$ implies $\nu = m + 1/2$. The mode numbers are half-integers: $\nu = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, \ldots$ The Möbius surface is the simplest non-orientable 2D manifold with boundary.

| Symbol | Name | Values | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| $m$ | Harmonic | $0, 1, 2, \ldots$ | Harmonic count |
| $\nu$ | Mode number | $m + 1/2$ | Half-integer from BC |

**Ground state selection.** The structure selects the fundamental harmonic ($m = 0$) by operational definition. Cosmological parameters ($\Lambda$, $H_0$) describe the homogeneous, isotropic background. The ground state is the unique mode with no internal nodes; excited modes ($m > 0$) possess spatial nodes and oscillating polarity. Two arguments exclude $m > 0$ for background observables:

| Argument | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Isotropy | $m > 0$ nodes create $O(1)$ anisotropy; CMB is isotropic to $10^{-5}$ |
| Orthogonality | Cosmological measurements integrate over Gpc volumes; oscillating modes average to zero |

Higher harmonics are excluded for background observables but carry perturbation structure.

### The Hypersphere Space $S^3$

The 3D volume containing the surface. Couples gravitationally; no other cross-manifold couplings are derived.

$$\partial S^3 = \emptyset$$

The hierarchy terminates here. "What's outside?" is malformed; there is no boundary from which to observe.

| Manifold | Boundary | Description |
|---|---|---|
| $S^1$ | $\partial S^1 = \emptyset$ | Closed loop; boundary of Möbius |
| Möbius | $\partial M = S^1$ | Non-orientable; embedded in $S^3$ |
| $S^3$ | $\partial S^3 = \emptyset$ | Orientable space; boundless |

**Uniqueness.** Spin compatibility and non-orientability left no other topological choice:

*The Edge and Surface* ($S^1$, Möbius): By the classification of compact surfaces, a connected non-orientable manifold with a single boundary component ($S^1$) is formed by removing a disk from the connected sum of $k$ crosscaps. The Möbius strip is the minimal case ($k = 1$); no simpler non-orientable surface with boundary exists.

*The Space* ($S^3$): By the Poincaré theorem, $S^3$ is the only simply connected closed 3-manifold. It is diffeomorphic to $\text{SU}(2)$ and admits a spin structure; no other alternative exists.

*The Terminus* ($\partial S^3 = \emptyset$): The space has no boundary. The hierarchy does not continue.

### Universal Constants

| Const. | Value | Role in MIT |
|---|---|---|
| $c$ | 299,792,458 m/s | Propagation rate on the temporal edge $S^1$ |
| $\hbar$ | $1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s | Action quantum; converts mode number to energy |
| $\ell_P$ | $1.616 \times 10^{-35}$ m | UV floor of the bounded domain |
| $t_P$ | $5.391 \times 10^{-44}$ s | Planck time; reference scale for $H_0$ |
| $a_P$ | $5.561 \times 10^{51}$ m/s² | Planck acceleration; reference scale for $a_0$ |

## The Cosmic Standing Wave $\Psi$

Anti-periodicity, the Neumann condition, and ground-state selection permit only one standing wave solution on the Möbius boundary: $\Psi$ is the wave that carries time.

### Wavelength

A period of $4\pi$ is required to carry the sign from positive through negative and back to positive: $\Psi(t + 4\pi) = \Psi(t)$.

Let $t \equiv 2\pi s/L$ denote cosmic phase, where $s$ is location along $S^1$ and $L$ is the circumference. (At Planck scale, the boundary condition manifests as the spin-$1/2$ sign flip under $2\pi$ rotation. Their correspondence is the dimensional projection of the same topological constraint.) The standing wave takes the form:

$$\Psi = \cos(t/2)$$

Cosine is inherited because the universe initiates at maximum amplitude $\Psi = +1$ rather than mid-slope.

### The Present Epoch

The phase definition $t \equiv 2\pi s/L$ means a full $4\pi$ cycle requires two laps of $S^1$: $\Delta s = 2L$ comoving. The comoving circumference $L \approx 2.1$ Gpc translates to a cycle duration $T_\text{cycle} \approx 33.2$ Gyr through the standard Friedmann expansion history ($\Omega_m = 0.315$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.685$, $H_0 = 67.4$ km/s/Mpc). The topology sets the cycle structure; the expansion history converts comoving distance to cosmic time. With $t_\text{age} = 13.8$ Gyr:

$$t = 4\pi \times \frac{13.8}{33.2} \approx 5.22 \text{ rad}$$

The epoch offset $\delta \equiv t - 2\pi$ measures angular distance from turnaround: $\delta = 5.22 - 6.28 = -1.06$ rad. In the native clock of the 120 domain, the observer sits at step ~50 of 120, approximately 10 chronon steps (2.8 Gyr) before turnaround at step 60.

| $\Psi$ | Step | $t$ (rad) | Epoch | ~Gyr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $+1$ | 0 | 0 | Initial | 0 |
| $0$ | 30 | $\pi$ (3.14) | First crossing | 8.3 |
| *$-0.86$* | *~50* | *$2\pi + \delta$ (5.22)* | *Present* | *13.8* |
| $-1$ | 60 | $2\pi$ (6.28) | Turnaround | 16.6 |
| $0$ | 90 | $3\pi$ (9.42) | Second crossing | 24.9 |
| $+1$ | 120 | $4\pi$ (12.57) | Completion | 33 |

**Bounded completion.** The bounded topology implies a different end state than heat death. Anti-periodic boundary conditions select standing-wave solutions. The second half of the cycle ($2\pi \to 4\pi$) is the universe settling into resonance rather than dissipating into void.

**Phantom crossing.** At turnaround ($t = 2\pi$), the standing wave crosses its geometric minimum. Fluid-based models interpret this as a phantom crossing of $w_\text{eff} = -1$. The corresponding redshift is $z_\text{cross} \approx 0.66$. The phase offset $\delta = -1.06$ rad is [pre-registered](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18189078).

## Cosmic Scale

### The Scale Hierarchy

Two scales govern the structure. The de Sitter scale:

$$\Omega_\Lambda \equiv \left(\frac{R_\Lambda}{\ell_P}\right)^2 \approx 10^{122}$$

where $R_\Lambda = \sqrt{3/\Lambda_\text{obs}}$ is the de Sitter radius (in units where $c = 1$), whose scale is fixed by the cosmological constant. And the Hubble scale:

$$\Omega_H(z) \equiv \left(\frac{R_H(z)}{\ell_P}\right)^2 \approx 10^{122}\ (z \approx 0)$$

where $R_H(z) = c/H(z)$ is the Hubble radius at redshift $z$, whose scale evolves with time. At the present epoch $t \approx 5.22$ rad, the Hubble horizon converges on the de Sitter horizon: $\Omega_H \approx \Omega_\Lambda$. This is not a "problem of cosmic coincidence"; it is near the temporal midpoint of $\Psi$.

The squared definition reflects horizon area: the relevant degrees of freedom scale with boundary. $\Omega_\Lambda$ is the asymptotic limit; $\Omega_H$ evolves with the Hubble radius.

### The Observer $\sqrt{\Omega}$

The observer occupies $\sqrt{\Omega_H} \approx 10^{61}$ at the present epoch: the geometric mean between cosmic scale ($10^{122}$) and Planck scale ($\sim 10^0$).

**Derivation.** The bounded domain spans from $\Omega \approx 10^{122}$ (horizon) to $10^0$ (Planck). On this domain, consider the IR↔UV symmetry $x \mapsto \Omega/x$. The fixed point satisfies:

$$x = \Omega/x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \Omega \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{\Omega}$$

On a log scale, $\sqrt{\Omega} \approx 10^{61}$ is the midpoint: $(122 + 0)/2 = 61$. This is a structural position, not anthropic selection.

### Structural vs. temporal midpoint

The structural midpoint $\sqrt{\Omega_H} \approx 10^{61}$ is constitutive; it defines *where* observation resolves. The temporal midpoint $t \approx 2\pi$ is contingent; it describes *when* we happen to observe. Both coincide near the present epoch. $S^1$ is the anchor manifold for phase; "observer at $S^1$" means temporal existence is parametrized by the 1D edge, not literal confinement to a point.

**Notation.** The dilution factor $\Omega^{-n/2}$ becomes $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$: the observer's position raised to power $-n$.

### The Scale Factor

Mode intensity dilutes in an embedded manifold:

$$(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$$

The scale $\Omega = (R/\ell_P)^2$ counts Planck areas on the horizon. The characteristic linear scale is $L \sim \Omega^{1/2} = \sqrt{\Omega}$. The volume of an $n$-dimensional manifold scales as $V_n \sim (\sqrt{\Omega})^n$. A normalized scalar mode has local intensity $|\psi|^2 \sim (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$.

### Manifold Index

The manifold index $n$ specifies which scale governs the mode being sampled.

| $n$ | Manifold | $\Omega$ | $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ | Observables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Temporal edge | $\Omega_H$ | $10^{-61}$ | $H_0$, $a_0$, $\Delta t_{\min} = \pi/30$, $\Delta S_{\min} = \hbar\pi/30$ |
| 2 | Möbius surface | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-122}$ | $\Lambda$ |
| 3/2 | Gauss-Codazzi interface | -- | -- | Gravity (space → surface curvature conversion) |
| 3 | Space | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | $10^{-183}$ | Null "dark matter" |

The access hierarchy follows from boundary structure: $S^1$ is the observer's anchor (direct); Möbius is accessed through its non-orientable twist; $S^3$ has no boundary ($\partial S^3 = \emptyset$). Spatial degrees of freedom enter only through reconstruction.

### Why edge uses $\Omega_H$ while surface uses $\Omega_\Lambda$

The temporal edge $S^1$ is where time happens; only the edge can reference a quantity that evolves with cosmic time. The Hubble horizon $R_H(z) = c/H(z)$ evolves; therefore epoch-dependent observables ($H_0$, $a_0$) reference $\Omega_H$. The Möbius surface and $S^3$ space are defined by $\Lambda$, which sets the boundary condition itself. Boundary conditions do not evolve; therefore epoch-independent observables reference $\Omega_\Lambda$. The space ($n = 3$) scaling of $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-3} \sim 10^{-183}$ suppresses any non-gravitational signal to observational null.

### Selection Rules

The manifold index, scale, and dilution are determined by the character of the observable:

| Observable | Character | $n$ | $\Omega$ | Why this $\Omega$ | $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\alpha$ | Epoch-ind., dimensionless | $1/30$ | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | Grid-resolution exponent | $\Omega_\Lambda^{-1/60}$ |
| $H_0$, $a_0$ | Epoch-dependent | 1 | $\Omega_H$ | Edge references evolving horizon | $10^{-61}$ |
| $\Lambda$ | Epoch-ind., geometric | 2 | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | Surface BC is fixed | $10^{-122}$ |
| "Dark matter" | Gravity-only | 3 | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | Space has no gauge coupling | $10^{-183}$ |

> Dimensionless couplings ($A_P = 1$) bypass manifold dilution; $n$ is fractional.

**Exclusion test.** Wrong manifold assignments fail by 61 orders of magnitude. $\Lambda$ as an edge mode ($n = 1$) would give $10^{-61}$, not $10^{-122}$. $H_0$ as a surface mode ($n = 2$) would give $10^{-122}$, not $10^{-61}$. The assignments are consistent with selection rules (epoch-dependence, coupling character); wrong assignments fail catastrophically.

## The Phase Operator

### The Phase Operator $C(\Theta)$

Different locations on the standing wave carry different observable amplitude. The phase operator $C(\Theta)$ encodes this variation:

$$C(\Theta) = 2\sin^2(\pi\Theta)$$

This function vanishes at $\Theta = 0$ and $\Theta = 1$ (the boundaries), and reaches maximum $C = 2$ at $\Theta = 1/2$ (the antinode).

**Derivation.** The Möbius $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy admits periodic and anti-periodic sectors. Matter is fermionic; this selects the anti-periodic sector. The constant mode is excluded: $\psi = \text{const}$ requires $\psi(\Theta+1) = +\psi(\Theta)$. The ground state is the lowest allowed mode, with eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = (\pi/L)^2 \neq 0$. The ground state wavefunction satisfying $\psi(\Theta+1) = -\psi(\Theta)$ is:

$$\psi_0(\Theta) = \sin(\pi\Theta)$$

Observable intensity is $|\psi|^2$. The mean is $\int_0^1 \sin^2(\pi\Theta)\,d\Theta = 1/2$. Normalizing to unit mean intensity sets the peak amplitude to 2, yielding $C(\Theta) = 2\sin^2(\pi\Theta)$.

$H_0$ and $a_0$ are both edge modes ($n=1$) with different magnitudes, so the wave must vary with position. Only the anti-periodic sector does; the periodic sector would give $C(\Theta) = 1$ everywhere with no variation.

### Phase Position $\Theta$

Phase position parametrizes where an observable resolves on the mode spectrum; it is distinct from the cosmic phase $t$. The cosmic phase $t$ locates the observer in the standing wave (*when*); the domain position $\Theta$ locates the observable (*where*).

$\Theta$ decomposes as:

$$\Theta = \Theta_0 + \Theta_f$$

where $\Theta_0$ is the Fibonacci well (fixed, geometric) and $\Theta_f$ is the phase field (local, varies by environment). These positions live on a structure with three levels of resolution.

**Resolution Terminology.** The domain is the space and the grid is the sampling. The 60R-grid is what survives to observation, where each level is derived from the topology. The remainder of this section builds them in order.

| Term | What it is | Resolution | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 120 domain | Topological structure | 120 positions | $|2I| = 120$ native to $S^3$ |
| Grid | Discrete sampling of the domain | 120 (fermionic) | Half-integer modes on the domain |
| 60R-grid | Realized observable lattice | 60 positions (even only) | $|\psi|^2$ projects $2I \to I$ |

### The 120 Domain

$C(\Theta)$ is continuous, but the mode spectrum is not. Half-integer modes sample discrete positions, and at generic positions they interfere destructively. By Hurwitz's theorem, the golden ratio $\varphi$ is the positive real most poorly approximated by rationals. Its convergents are the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci positions are where destructive interference is minimized: the stable sampling points.

These stable sampling points live at $F_n/120$. The maximum resolution the space provides is 120. $S^3$ is diffeomorphic to $\text{SU}(2)$; the binary icosahedral group $2I$ is its largest exceptional discrete subgroup, with $|2I| = 120$.

**Why 120 and no other number?** Five paths converge on the domain; three are independent, one is geometrically restated, and one is a consistency check:

- *Group-theoretic:* $|2I| = 120$, largest discrete spinor symmetry on $S^3$
- *Number-theoretic:* $\text{lcm}(1,2,3,5,8) = 120$, minimal domain for Fibonacci structure
- *Musical:* Consonance ratios $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,8\}$ independently yield $\text{lcm} = 120$. The ear is a physical phase detector; every musical tradition but Gamelan converges on these ratios without cultural transmission.
- *Angular:* Icosahedral symmetry partitions $S^2$ into 60 fundamental domains; the binary cover on $S^3$ doubles to 120.
- *Mode Identity Theory:* The scaling law requires irreducible fraction $13/120$ ($\gcd(13, 120) = 1$); no coarser domain accommodates the observed well structure.

The $(2,3,5)$ branch orders of the icosahedron are consecutive Fibonacci numbers satisfying $2 + 3 = 5$. This is why the group-theoretic and number-theoretic paths converge: the icosahedron is the unique Platonic solid whose symmetry orders obey the Fibonacci recurrence.

### The Chronon

If the domain has 120 positions and the wave has period $4\pi$, the smallest step is fixed. The smallest phase advance in cosmic phase $t$:

$$\Delta t_{\min} = \frac{4\pi}{120} = \frac{\pi}{30}$$

The chronon is not a universal tick; it is the smallest phase advance the domain can register, measured in radians of the cosmic phase $t$. For any mode with period $T$, the chronon is $\tau = T/120$. The resolution is scale-dependent. Time itself remains continuous; only the phase resolution is discrete.

The corresponding minimum action increment:

$$\Delta S_{\min} = \hbar\Delta t_{\min} = \frac{\hbar\pi}{30}$$

This is the smallest action the domain can resolve. Unlike the chronon, which scales with the mode, the action bound is absolute: action is a Lorentz scalar, so $\Delta S_{\min} = \hbar\pi/30$ holds in every frame.

### The Bosonic Filter

Fermions see the full 120. Observation squares the wavefunction, and half the resolution vanishes.

The wavefunction $\psi_0$ satisfies $\psi(\Theta+1) = -\psi(\Theta)$: it carries the sign flip from the anti-periodic boundary condition. The fermion distinguishes all 120 positions on the domain. Observation squares the wavefunction. $C = |\psi|^2$ erases the sign: $|\psi(\Theta+1)|^2 = |-\psi(\Theta)|^2 = |\psi(\Theta)|^2$. What was distinct to the fermion becomes identical to any measurement.

The consequence is halved resolution. The minimum step any observable can resolve is $2/120$, not $1/120$. The squaring projects $2I \to I$, where $I$ is the icosahedral rotation group ($|I| = 60$). Dimensionless couplings ($A_P = 1$) live on the resulting 60R-grid (R for realized): only even positions on the 120 domain. Dimensionful observables ($A_P \neq 1$) remain on the 120 domain; their sign information is absorbed by whole-manifold dilution.

### Fibonacci Wells ($\Theta_0$)

The Bosonic Filter established the 60R-grid; only certain positions carry observable amplitude. Fibonacci selects the stable wells; the antinode ($60/120$) is included as the amplitude maximum. The well at $13/120$ is irreducible: $\gcd(13, 120) = 1$. No coarser domain can represent it.

Not all Fibonacci wells survive to observation. The phase field carries microfluctuations $\delta\Theta_f^\text{micro} \lesssim 10^{-4}$, setting a noise floor. Below $F_7$, the amplitude is indistinguishable from noise: $C(8/120) = 0.087$. At $F_7$, the wave resolves: $C(13/120) = 0.22$.

The well assignments (which observable maps to which well) are identified by coprimality and observable character; the wells themselves are enumerated. Among edge modes, $a_0$ occupies the coprime well ($13/120$); $H_0$ is assigned to $34/120$ by matching $C(\Theta)$ to observed magnitude. The surviving wells become:

| $F_n$ | Well | $C(\Theta)$ | Observable |
|---|---|---|---|
| $F_7$ | 13/60† | 0.79 | $\alpha$ (fine structure constant) |
| $F_7$ | 13/120 | 0.22 | $a_0$ (acceleration scale) |
| $F_8$ | 21/120 | 0.55 | Unassigned |
| $F_9$ | 34/120 | 1.21 | $H_0$ (Hubble parameter) |
| $F_{10}$ | 55/120 | 1.97 | Unassigned |
| -- | 60/120 | 2.00 | $\Lambda_\text{top}$ (cosmological constant) |

> †The Bosonic Filter projects $13/120 \to 13/60$ on the 60R-grid.

**Coprimality note:** $\gcd(13, 120) = 1$. The $13/120$ well shares no factors with the domain, making it maximally detached from the domain's own symmetry. Matter lives there. The structural observables ($\Lambda$, $H_0$) occupy wells with shared factors, coupled to the domain structure itself. The assignment is forced: swapping wells inverts the ratio by a factor of 30.

### Phase Field ($\Theta_f$)

The wells are locked by topology. The observer is not. The local gravitational environment shifts the sampling position away from the well center.

For global observations (CMB, BAO), the shift averages out: $\Theta_f \approx 0$. Integration over gigaparsec volumes erases local structure. For local observations, $\Theta_f$ reflects the observer's environment. The phase field decomposes as:

$$\Theta_f = \Theta_f^{\text{env}} + \delta\Theta_f^{\text{micro}}$$

The environmental component $\Theta_f^\text{env}$ is the coherent offset from local structure. The microfluctuation $\delta\Theta_f^\text{micro}$ is noise that averages out ($\lesssim 10^{-4}$).

For the Milky Way, $\Theta_f^\text{env} \approx 2/120$, the minimum bosonic step: the smallest shift the 60R-grid can register. At $\Theta_0 = 34/120$, this step shifts $C(\Theta)$ by 8.4%:

$$\frac{C(36/120)}{C(34/120)} = \frac{1.309}{1.208} = 1.084$$

This 8.4% resolves the Hubble tension. Local measurements of $H_0$ sample inside the Milky Way's phase field; CMB-derived values integrate over gigaparsec volumes where $\Theta_f \approx 0$. The discrepancy is environment-dependent sampling of the same well.

### A. Phase Field Mechanics

The Fibonacci wells have different sensitivities to environmental shifts. Wells near the boundary of the domain are steep; wells near the antinode are flat. This determines how much each observable changes when the phase field is active. The remainder of the section builds the trigger mechanism: what gravitational conditions activate the phase field, over what spatial scale, and why the shift locks at exactly one bosonic step.

### B. Logarithmic Slope

The sensitivity of $C(\Theta)$ to small shifts:

$$\frac{d \ln C}{d\Theta} = 2\pi \cot(\pi\Theta)$$

The cotangent diverges near the boundary and vanishes at the antinode. $\Lambda$ sits at the antinode ($\Theta = 60/120$): its slope is exactly zero. The cosmological constant is topologically protected because no environmental shift can move it.

| Well | $\Theta$ | $C(\Theta)$ | Slope |
|---|---|---|---|
| $a_0$ | 13/120 | 0.22 | 17.7 |
| $H_0$ | 34/120 | 1.21 | 5.1 |
| $\Lambda_\text{top}$ | 60/120 | 2.00 | 0 |

### C. Shift Amplification

The Bosonic Filter fixed $\Delta\Theta_{\min} = 2/120$. Multiplying slope by step ($\Delta C/C = (d\ln C/d\Theta) \times \Delta\Theta_{\min}$) gives the fractional shift at each well:

| Well | Slope × 2/120 | Shift |
|---|---|---|
| $a_0$ | 17.7 × 1/60 | 30% |
| $H_0$ | 5.1 × 1/60 | 8.4% |
| $\Lambda_\text{top}$ | 0 × 1/60 | 0% |

The $a_0$ well is steep (one bosonic step would shift its amplitude by 30%), but $a_0$ is constitutive: it defines $\mathcal{T}_c$ and $L_f$, and is only measurable inside triggered environments. The observed $a_0$ corresponds to the Fibonacci well. $H_0$ shifts by 8.4%, matching the Hubble tension. $\Lambda$ remains unmoved.

### D. Coherence Scale

Dimensional analysis admits exactly one length from $v_c$ and $a_0$:

$$L_f = \frac{v_c^2}{a_0}$$

For the Milky Way ($v_c \approx 220$ km/s), $L_f \approx 13$ kpc.

### E. The Trigger

The phase field activates when the gravitational potential drop across $L_f$ exceeds a critical threshold. Defining $\Phi_{\text{rel}}(l) \equiv \Phi(l_{\text{out}}) - \Phi(l)$, the dimensionless trigger index is:

$$\mathcal{T} \equiv \frac{2}{c^2 L_f} \int_0^{L_f} \Phi_{\text{rel}}(l)\,dl$$

### F. Threshold

The trigger fires when $\mathcal{T}$ exceeds a critical value. The geometry factor $\xi \approx 0.46$ captures the mean potential depth (isothermal, NFW, and Hernquist all give 0.44 to 0.47):

$$\mathcal{T}_c = \frac{2\xi\,a_0\,L_f}{c^2}$$

### G. Response

Once triggered, the phase field locks to the minimum bosonic step. The response is binary:

$$\Theta_f = \frac{2}{120} \cdot \mathbf{1}(\mathcal{T} \geq \mathcal{T}_c)$$

where $\mathbf{1}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function. Below threshold: $\Theta_f = 0$. Above: $\Theta_f = 2/120$. No continuous slide; the 60R-grid fixes the step. Higher-order transitions ($4/120$, $6/120$, $\ldots$) are inaccessible within a single coherence scale.

**Closure Identity.** Substituting $L_f = v_c^2/a_0$ into $\mathcal{T}_c$, the acceleration scale cancels: $\mathcal{T}_c = 2\xi v_c^2/c^2$. Both $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}_c$ scale as $v_c^2$; the ratio is galaxy-independent:

$$\frac{\mathcal{T}}{\mathcal{T}_c} = \frac{1}{\xi} \approx 2.2$$

### Galactic Disk Phase Shift

For every disk galaxy with a flat rotation curve, $\mathcal{T} > \mathcal{T}_c$; edge observables sampled from inside are shifted by the phase field. The Milky Way ($v_c \approx 220$ km/s):

**Coherence scale.**

$$L_f = \frac{v_c^2}{a_0} = \frac{(2.2 \times 10^5)^2}{1.2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 4 \times 10^{20}\text{ m} \approx 13\text{ kpc}$$

**Threshold.**

$$\mathcal{T}_c = \frac{2\xi\,v_c^2}{c^2} = \frac{2(0.46)(2.2 \times 10^5)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} \approx 4.9 \times 10^{-7}$$

**Trigger index.**

Triggered. The shifted well:

$$H_0^{\text{local}} = H_0^{\text{CMB}} \times \frac{C(36/120)}{C(34/120)} = 67.4 \times 1.084 \approx 73\text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

| Quantity | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| $v_c$ | 220 km/s | Milky Way circular velocity |
| $a_0$ | $1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s² | $F_7 = 13/120$ well |
| $L_f$ | 13 kpc | $v_c^2/a_0$ |
| $\xi$ | 0.46 | Geometry factor (profile-insensitive) |
| $\mathcal{T}_c$ | $4.9 \times 10^{-7}$ | Critical threshold |
| $\mathcal{T}_\text{MW}$ | $1.1 \times 10^{-6}$ | Milky Way trigger index |
| $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}_c$ | 2.2 | $= 1/\xi$, galaxy-independent |
| $\Theta_f$ | $2/120$ | One bosonic step (locked) |
| $\Delta H_0$ | 8.4% | $C(36/120)/C(34/120) = 1.084$ |

Every distance ladder calibrated from inside the Milky Way has been phase shifted 8.4% by the field. No amount of precision will resolve the tension unless we move Earth. The CMB gives us the true value of $H_0$.

## The Scaling Law

The framework reduces to one equation:

$$\frac{A}{A_P} \approx C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$$

$C(\Theta)$ reads the position axis: where the observable sits on the mode spectrum. $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ reads the time axis through $\Omega_H$ for edge modes, or the boundary condition through $\Omega_\Lambda$ for surface modes. The observer at $\sqrt{\Omega}$ is the structural midpoint where both axes resolve to finite values. Their product yields $A/A_P$: the modal realization; the ratio of the observable amplitude over its Planck scale reference. **The event occurs at $(t, \Theta)$.**

### The assembled engine

| Observable | $A_P$ | Grid | $\Theta$ | $C$ | $n$ | $A/A_P$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\alpha$ | 1 | 60R | 13/60 | 0.79 | $1/30$ † | $7.33 \times 10^{-3}$ |
| $a_0$ | $a_P$ | 120 | 13/120 | 0.22 | 1 | $2.2 \times 10^{-62}$ |
| $H_0$ | $t_P^{-1}$ | 120 | 34/120 | 1.21 | 1 | $1.2 \times 10^{-61}$ |
| $\Lambda$ | $\ell_P^{-2}$ | 120 | 60/120 | 2.00 | 2 | $3.0 \times 10^{-122}$ ‡ |

> †Dimensionless couplings ($A_P = 1$) project to the 60R-grid; $n$ is the minimum resolved step.
> ‡ $\Lambda_\text{obs} = (3/2) \times \Lambda_\text{top}$. The 3/2 Gauss-Codazzi conversion is included in $A/A_P$.

$H_0$ and $a_0$ occupy different wells on the same edge; their ratio is fixed by position. $H_0$ and $\Lambda$ occupy different manifolds; their 61-order span is fixed by dimension. $\alpha$ occupies the same well as $a_0$ on the 60R-grid; its exponent is fixed by resolution.

### Derivation chain

Each component traces to the single topological postulate:

| Component | Source |
|---|---|
| $m = 0$ | Isotropy + orthogonality |
| $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ | IR↔UV fixed point + volume scaling |
| $n = 1, 2, 3$ | Epoch-dependence + coupling character |
| $C(\Theta) = 2\sin^2(\pi\Theta)$ | Anti-periodic BC + unit normalization |
| $\Theta$ on 120 domain | $S^3 \cong \text{SU}(2)$ polyhedral subgroup resolution + irreducibility |
| $\Theta \in \{13, 21, 34, 55, 60\}/120$ | Hurwitz stability + amplitude threshold |
| $\Delta\Theta_{\min} = 2/120$ | Bosonic Filter (spinor → scalar) |
| $L_f = v_c^2/a_0$ | Coherence scale |
| $\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{T}_c$, $\Theta_f$ response | Gauge-invariant trigger + threshold + step function |
| $R_\Sigma = \Lambda_\text{top}$ | Scaling law bridge (identification) |

### Symbol Glossary

Observables are located in time on the edge and positioned on the mode spectrum. Cosmic phase $t$ sets *when*; phase position $\Theta$ sets *where*. Three scales complete the framework.

| Symbol | Name | Domain | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| $t$ | Cosmic phase | $[0, 4\pi]$ | Observer's phase location on $\Psi$; time in MIT is phase |
| $\delta$ | Epoch offset | $\sim -1.06$ rad | How far from turnaround |
| $\Omega$ | Scale | $(R/\ell_P)^2$ | Planck areas on horizon $\sim 10^{122}$ |
| $\Omega_H$ | Hubble scale | $(R_H/\ell_P)^2$ | Evolves with epoch |
| $\Omega_\Lambda$ | de Sitter scale | $(R_\Lambda/\ell_P)^2$ | Fixed by $\Lambda$ |
| $\Theta$ | Phase position | $[0,1]$ on 120 | Observable's position on mode spectrum |
| $\Theta_0$ | Fibonacci well | $\{13, 21, 34, 55, 60\}/120$ | Fixed geometric position |
| $\Theta_f$ | Phase field | 0 or $2/120$ | Local environmental shift |

## Discussion

Cosmological anomalies have been resolved and particle structure has been given shape. What remains is to locate Mode Identity Theory in the theoretical landscape and specify falsification criteria.

## Predictions and Falsification

MIT has no loose knobs; discrepancies cannot be absorbed by parameter adjustment. The framework stands or falls on population-level agreement with locked predictions.

### Numerical scorecard

Blind outputs of the scaling law:

| Observable | Predicted | Observed | Agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\alpha$ | 0.00733 | 0.007297 | ~0.5% |
| $a_0/(cH_0)$ | 0.184 | 0.183 | < 1% |
| $H_0$ local shift | 8.4% | ~8.7% (67.4 → 73.2) | < 1% |
| $\Lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot \ell_P^2$ | $3.0 \times 10^{-122}$ | $2.84 \times 10^{-122}$ | ~5% |
| CMB suppression | $\ell \sim 31$ | $\ell < 30$ | ~ |
| CMB parity | $R_{TT} < 1$ | $R_{TT} \approx 0.81$ | ✓ |
| CMB alignment | ~13° | ~10° | ~ |

The framework also retrodicts three particle generations (three isolated vacua), massless bosons (edge-only propagation), and neutrino parity violation (non-orientability). These match known physics; they are structural consequences, checked against observation.

### Falsification hierarchy

(1) Single-object disagreement: tension. (2) Multiple independent measurements: severe tension. (3) Statistical-sample exclusion at ≥ 2σ with controlled systematics: falsification.

### Primary predictions

Failure of any one falsifies the framework.

| Prediction | Falsified if | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ | $a_0$ consistent with constant at high $z$ | ≥ 2σ, $z > 2$ |
| $\Lambda$ constant | $\rho_{\text{DE}}(z)$ shows significant evolution | ≥ 2σ |
| CMB suppression | Wrong suppression scale | $\ell_{\text{cut}} \notin [15, 50]$ |

### Secondary predictions

These do not individually falsify MIT but meaningfully raise or lower credibility.

| Prediction | Falsified if | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Null particle dark matter | Non-gravitational interaction confirmed | ≥ 5σ, replicated |
| $H_0$ discrete | Continuous environmental variation confirmed | Histogram test |
| $z_{\text{cross}} \approx 0.66$ | Phantom crossing outside locked range | < 0.4 or > 0.9 |
| $w_{\text{eff}} > -1$ at all $z$ | True phantom behavior confirmed | Euclid, Rubin |
| $w(z)$ curvature | Linear CPL preferred over cosine modulation | $\Delta$AIC > 4 |
| $\mu_\Lambda \approx 2.25$ meV | Lightest $\nu$ mass inconsistent | KATRIN, cosmological bounds |

## Scope and Position

MIT is a topological framework: it specifies boundary conditions and permitted mode structure. Boundary conditions are prior to dynamics. Standard dynamics describes the music; MIT defines the instrument.

**What MIT does claim.** One postulate (topology), one domain boundary ($\ell_P$), one calibration layer (well-to-observable assignments). The scaling law $A/A_P \approx C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ and every component in it trace to the topology postulate.

**What MIT does not modify.** Einstein's field equations and the Standard Model particle content are unchanged. MIT addresses why observables take their values and why gauge fields confine into three generations.

**Parallel work.** Topological cosmology has been explored since Friedmann. Luminet, Weeks, and collaborators proposed the Poincaré dodecahedral space ($S^3/2I$) as the spatial topology of the universe, matching CMB low-$\ell$ suppression; MIT adopts the same manifold and extends it from CMB anomalies to particle structure.

The COMPACT collaboration calculates eigenmodes of non-orientable Euclidean manifolds, closely overlapping the mathematics MIT requires; their analysis of parity asymmetry from topology alone aligns with MIT's derivation of odd-$\ell$ preference.

Milgrom's MOND established $a_0$ as a fundamental acceleration scale; MIT derives it as an edge mode and predicts its evolution with $H(z)$, the central fork test against MOND's constant $a_0$.
