# Contributing to Mode Identity Theory

## The Ground Rules

This is not "believe me." This is "watch the bet resolve."

Predictions are locked. The framework is open for stress-testing.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Stress-Test the Derivations

The derivation chain is in [Axioms.md](Axioms.md). Each step is marked LOCKED.

Questions to ask:
- Does Step N follow from Step N-1?
- Are there hidden assumptions?
- Is the logic internally consistent?

File an issue if you find a gap.

### 2. Check the Math

The scaling law predictions can be verified:

| Observable | Formula | Claimed Value |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Λ/M⁴_P | Ω⁻¹ · C(60/120) | 2.0 × 10⁻¹²² |
| H₀ · t_P | Ω⁻¹/² · C(34/120) | 1.2 × 10⁻⁶¹ |
| a₀/a_P | Ω⁻¹/² · C(13/120) | 2.1 × 10⁻⁶² |

Where:
- Ω ≈ 10¹²²
- C(α) = 2sin²(πα)

### 3. Propose Tests

What else does MIT predict that hasn't been specified?

Useful proposals include:
- Observable consequence
- How to measure it
- What result would falsify MIT

### 4. Wait for Euclid

## What's Not Useful

- "This contradicts mainstream physics" — We know. That's the point.
- "You should submit to journals" — After Euclid.
- Tone policing — Focus on the math.
