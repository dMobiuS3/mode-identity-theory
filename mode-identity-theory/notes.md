## Locked Predictions (Pre-Registered)

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18189079  
**Locked:** January 8, 2026  
**Judgment Day:** October 21, 2026 (Euclid DR1)

| Parameter | MIT Value | Falsified If |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Phase offset Î´ | âˆ’1.06 rad | (fixed) |
| Phantom crossing z_cross | 0.66 Â± 0.12 | z_cross < 0.4 OR > 0.9 |
| w(z) curvature | dÂ²w/dzÂ² â‰  0 | Linear CPL preferred at Î”Ï‡Â² > 4 |
| Physical Î› | Constant | Î›(z)/Î›(0) â‰  1 at 2Ïƒ |
| wâ‚€ (inferred) | âˆ’0.85 to âˆ’0.70 | Outside range |

### The Core Claim

**What evolves is perspective, not Î›.**

The cosmic standing wave Î¨(t) = cos(t/2) imprints phase-dependent structure. Observers fitting fluid-based models recover varying w(z) not because Î› changes, but because the framework can't capture phase position.

### w_eff(z) Inference Signature

$$w_{eff}(z) = -1 - \varepsilon \cdot \cos\left[\frac{2\pi + \delta}{2(1+z)}\right]$$

Where:
- Îµ â‰ˆ 0.25 (amplitude, mid-band; implied by wâ‚€ and Î´)
- Î´ = âˆ’1.06 rad (phase offset, locked)

w_eff is not a physical property of dark energy. It is what observers recover when fitting constant-Î› reality with evolving-w tools.

## The Waltz

### One Boundary, Two Observations

The MÃ¶bius strip has exactly **one boundary** (theorem, not interpretation).

| Notation | Observation | What you see | Scale |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| âˆ‚M\|â‚ | Direct (here) | Planck floor | â„“_P, local |
| âˆ‚M\|â‚‚ | Through twist | Cosmic horizon | R_Î›, de Sitter |

Looking across the MÃ¶bius surface, the observer sees the "other side" of the edge. But there is no other side. It is the **same SÂ¹**, seen through the non-orientable twist.

### The Partners

The chronon (quantum of temporal sampling at âˆ‚M|â‚) and neutrino mass scale (âˆ‚M|â‚‚) are not two things coupling. They are the **same edge**, sampled from two projection depths.

- **Fermionic character:** The 4Ï€ rotation requirement IS the boundary condition
- **Parity violation:** Non-orientable topology inherently breaks parity
- **Neutrino handedness:** The weak force's left-handedness is the signature of the twist

### The Rhyme

| | The Waltz | The Rhyme |
|-|-----------|-----------|
| Partners | Chronon â†” Neutrino | Fibonacci â†” Consonance |
| Function | Sampling (creates moments) | Coherence (connects them) |
| Mechanism | Same edge, two projections | Different paths, same 120 |

$$|2I| = 120 = \text{LCM}(1,2,3,5,8) = \text{LCM}(1,2,3,4,5,6,8)$$

The Waltz makes the notes. The Rhyme makes them a song.

---

## The Siphon

### Î¼_Î› as Source

**Core claim:** All massive matter derives from Î¼_Î› â‰ˆ 2.25 meV, not the reverse.

| Old thinking | Siphon thinking |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Î› is fundamental, m_Î½ derived from Î›^(1/4) | Î¼_Î› is fundamental; Î› is ground mode (m=0), m_Î½ are excitations (m>0) |
| Neutrino masses need explanation | Neutrinos are cleanest signal of source |
| Standard Model masses are separate problem | Same wave, higher excitation, 120-grid binding |

### The Hierarchy

| Level | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | The Waltz | âˆ‚M sampled at two projection depths â†’ Î¼_Î› â‰ˆ 2.25 meV |
| 1 | The Rhyme | Fibonacci (wells) + Consonance (bonds) â†’ both LCM = 120 |
| 2 | The Filter | Coprime to 120 â†’ propagates; Divisors of 120 â†’ binds |
| 3 | Elements | Consonant configurations in the 120-grid |

### Unified Attribution

| Phenomenon | Notation | Attribution |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Î¼_Î› â‰ˆ 2.25 meV | â€” | **The source** (fundamental scale from Waltz) |
| Dark energy (Î›) | âˆ‚M\|â‚‚(60/120, 0) | Ground mode (m=0) of Î¼_Î› |
| Neutrino mass | âˆ‚M\|â‚‚(?, m) | Excitations (m>0) of Î¼_Î› |
| MOND scale (aâ‚€) | âˆ‚M\|â‚(13/120) | Edge mode |
| Hubble (Hâ‚€) | âˆ‚M\|â‚(34/120) | Edge mode |
| Dark matter | SÂ³ | Bulk geometry (the venue) |
| Gravity | SÂ³ â†’ âˆ‚M | Converted geometry (the venue's voice) |
| Visible matter | 120-grid | Consonant configurations (the music) |

**The 95% "dark" universe is the venue. The 5% visible is the music.**

---

## Observation Paradigm

### Where is "Here" vs "There"?

The distinction is **projection depth**, not location in a bulk container.

| Concept | Notation | Definition |
|---------|----------|------------|
| "Here" | âˆ‚M\|â‚ | Direct sampling of the temporal edge (local, present) |
| "There" | âˆ‚M\|â‚‚ | The same edge viewed through the non-orientable twist (horizon, past) |
| "The Venue" | SÂ³ | Bulk geometry that enforces the structure but has no boundary to stand on |

### Distance as Phase Lag

SÂ¹ is the temporal edge. Separation along SÂ¹ is phase separation (lookback time, not spatial displacement).

| What we say | What it means in MIT |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "10 billion light-years away" | 10 billion years of phase lag on SÂ¹ |
| "Light traveled through space" | Signal traversed the loop through the twist |
| "Hubble expansion" | Phase relationships evolving on SÂ¹ |

Cosmological lookback = phase lag on SÂ¹. Spatial metric = GR (unchanged). MIT changes boundary conditions, not field equations.

### Scale Separation

| Scale | What's happening | Notation |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Local (meters, AU) | Subluminal dynamics on/through MÃ¶bius (interface) | n=2 surface |
| Signals/causality | Carried on SÂ¹ at c | âˆ‚M\|â‚ |
| Cosmological (Mpc, Gpc) | Phase lag on SÂ¹ viewed through surface | âˆ‚M\|â‚ through âˆ‚M\|â‚‚ |

**Carrier vs. content:** The edge (SÂ¹) is the causal carrier (null propagation, the signaling limit). The surface (MÃ¶bius) is where massive structure lives. The wave propagates at c on the edge; the mass is a surface harmonic (different aspects of the same mode).

### CMB: Maximum Projection Depth

The CMB represents near-maximum projection depth (âˆ‚M\|â‚‚).

**Two distinct roles:**
- **Recombination / last scattering:** The visibility filter (what you can see electromagnetically)
- **Topology:** Sets the allowed eigenmodes (why the low-â„“ structure looks anomalous)

### CMB Axis (Topological Prediction)

MIT predicts a **preferred axis** in the CMB from the topology's structure:
- The non-orientable identification creates a symmetry axis (the twist axis)
- Low-â„“ multipoles (quadrupole, octupole) align with this axis
- The alignment is favored by the shape of the manifold, not the position of the observer

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Preferred axis exists | Prediction (topological necessity) |
| Axis correlates with ecliptic | Empirical test (not required by MIT) |

---

## Gravity

### There Is No Graviton

SÂ³ has no boundary. The bulk doesn't couple through a shared edge (there is none).

**Gravity is what happens when non-orientable observation converts geometry into force.**

| Where | Notation | What exists |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Bulk | SÂ³ (n=3) | Geometry. No boundary, no time. Just is. |
| Surface | MÃ¶bius (n=2) | The twist (converts geometry to experience) |
| Edge | âˆ‚M (n=1) | Time, c, gravity as we observe it |

The bulk doesn't "have" gravity. The bulk has geometry. Gravity is what geometry **looks like** from the non-orientable surface.

### Why Gravity Is Different

| Property | MIT explanation |
|----------|-----------------|
| Couples to everything | Geometry IS everything in SÂ³ |
| Always attractive | Curvature has one sign from the edge |
| Weakest force | Î©â»Â¹ Ã— Î©â»Â¹/Â² = 10â»Â¹Â²Â² Ã— 10â»â¶Â¹ â‰ˆ 10â»Â¹â¸Â³ |
| Cannot be shielded | Cannot hide from the space you're in |
| Causes time dilation | Mass affects edge character; edge IS time |
| Resists quantization | Topology, not dynamics |
| No graviton found | None exists to find |

### Compatibility with GR

Einstein field equations: G_Î¼Î½ = 8Ï€T_Î¼Î½

MIT does not change this equation. MIT changes what it **describes**:
- G_Î¼Î½ describes SÂ³ geometry
- T_Î¼Î½ describes modal content on the edge
- The equation is the geometry-to-observation conversion formula

**General relativity is correct.** It is the conversion formula.

## The Polyhedral Filter

### Bosonic Filter Unification

The squaring operation |Ïˆ|Â² that produces C(Î±) IS the projection 2I â†’ I.

| Object | Period | Domain | Character |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Ïˆ (wavefunction) | 2 | 2I (120-grid) | Spinor / Fermionic |
| |Ïˆ|Â² (intensity) | 1 | I (60-grid) | Scalar / Bosonic |

**Physical interpretation:** The universe has a fermionic substrate (period-2 wavefunction) but bosonic geometry (period-1 intensity). The observation process itself performs the projection. Geometric observables (Î›, Hâ‚€, aâ‚€) live on the 60-grid because measurement involves |Ïˆ|Â², not Ïˆ.

### Filter Taxonomy

The 120-grid (2Â³ Ã— 3Â¹ Ã— 5Â¹) suggests four distinct behaviors:

| Category | Condition | Example | Behavior |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Pure consonance** | Divides 120 | 2, 8, 20 | Binds cleanly |
| **Amplitude overflow** | Exceeds prime exponent | 50 (has 5Â², grid has 5Â¹) | Pressure strain |
| **Tension-stabilized** | Contains coprime prime | 28 (has 7), 82 (has 41) | Binds with strain |
| **Fully coprime** | gcd(N, 120) = 1 | 7, 11, 13, 17 | Cannot bind â†’ propagates |

*Note: "Overflow" and "strain" are heuristic labels. The physical mechanism is OPEN.*

### Grid Capacity

| Prime | Grid capacity | Overflow at |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 2 | 2Â³ = 8 | 16, 32, ... |
| 3 | 3Â¹ = 3 | 9, 27, ... |
| 5 | 5Â¹ = 5 | 25, 50, ... |

**Neutrino mode indices** (1, 7, 11...) are coprime to 120 and therefore cannot be "absorbed" by the grid (they propagate).

**Matter binds** because its structure resonates with 2, 3, or 5 (but can strain under overflow or foreign primes).

### Music Theory Connection

$$|2I| = 120 = \text{LCM}(1,2,3,4,5,6,8)$$

The binary icosahedral group order **equals** the LCM of musical consonance ratios. Same number, same prime structure.

**Cross-cultural convergence:**

| System | Number | = 120 Ã· ? |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Western consonance grid | 120 | 1 |
| Chinese scales (12 lÃ¼ Ã— 5 modes) | 60 | 2 |
| Arabic quarter-tones | 24 | 5 |
| Western 12-TET | 12 | 10 |

All exact divisors. Multiple cultures independently converged on 120-related systems.

## Phase Field (Î±_f)

### The Decomposition

$$\alpha = \alpha_0 + \alpha_f$$

| Component | What it is | Behavior |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Î±â‚€ | Phase well position | Fixed, geometric (Fibonacci or midpoint) |
| Î±_f | Local environment contribution | Varies by context |
| Î± | Total sampled position | What observation actually sees |

**For global observations:** Î±_f â‰ˆ 0 (integration averages out local structure)

**For local observations:** Î±_f â‰  0 (observer's environment carries phase)

### Î±_f = 2/120: The Minimum Bosonic Step

The Bosonic Filter projects the 120-grid to the 60-grid (see Polyhedral Filter section). This means the **minimum visible step** for geometric observables is 2/120, not 1/120.

| Grid | Character | Minimum step |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 120 (2I) | Spinor/fermionic | 1/120 |
| 60 (I) | Scalar/bosonic | 2/120 |

**Î±_f = 2/120 â‰ˆ 0.017 is not arbitrary.** It is the smallest phase shift that geometric observables can resolve. The environment acts as a **trigger** selecting this quantized state, not as a continuous source.

### Î±_f and the Hubble Tension

This explains the ~9% discrepancy:

| Measurement | Source | Î±_f | Result |
|-------------|--------|-----|--------|
| CMB-derived Hâ‚€ | z â‰ˆ 1100 | â‰ˆ 0 (global) | Lower Hâ‚€ |
| Local Hâ‚€ | z â‰ˆ 0 | â‰  0 (local structure) | Higher Hâ‚€ |

**Prediction:** Local Hâ‚€ > CMB Hâ‚€, with tension maximal at present epoch.

The ~9% tension corresponds to Î±_f = 2/120, the minimum bosonic step.

**Internal consistency check:** At Î±â‚€ = 34/120, shifting by +0.017 increases C(Î±) = 2sinÂ²(Ï€Î±) by ~8.5%, matching the observed ~9% tension.

**Numerical closure:**

$$C(34/120) = 1.208, \quad C(36/120) = 1.309, \quad \text{Ratio} = 1.084$$

$$67.4 \times 1.084 = 73.1 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

This is output, not fit. The input is the lattice geometry; the ~8.4% emerges from the slope of C(Î±) at the Hâ‚€ well.

### Two Transmission Mechanisms

The phase field biases Hâ‚€ inference through two channels:

| Mechanism | What it affects | Behavior |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Calibration inheritance** | Local distance ladders | Full Î±_f (8.4%) inherited by all rungs |
| **Phase-domain averaging** | Geometric methods (BAO, lensing) | Î±_f contribution diluted over baseline |

**Rule:** Inheritance dominates when calibration is local; dilution applies when calibration is non-local.

- *Cepheid/TRGB ladders:* Anchored locally â†’ full 8.4% shift â†’ Hâ‚€ â‰ˆ 73
- *CMB-calibrated:* Global anchor â†’ no shift â†’ Hâ‚€ â‰ˆ 67
- *Geometric methods:* Intermediate, trending toward global with increasing baseline

### Derived Quantities

| Quantity | Formula | Value | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Coherence scale | L_f = v_cÂ²/aâ‚€ | ~13 kpc (MW) | **DERIVED** |
| Geometry factor | Î¾ (halo integral) | 0.46 Â± 0.02 | **DERIVED** |
| Threshold | T_c = 2Î¾v_cÂ²/cÂ² | â€” | **DERIVED** |

The coherence scale L_f marks where the MOND transition occurs. The same phase structure that produces the aâ‚€ scale determines the threshold for phase-field activation.

### Falsification: Discrete vs Continuous

**MIT predicts:** Hâ‚€ should cluster at discrete values (67, 73, ...), not vary continuously with environment.

**Test:** Histogram Hâ‚€ by environment bin. Check for bimodality vs continuous trend.

**Falsified if:** A continuous environment gradient in Hâ‚€ with no discrete clustering.

### Status Summary

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Why Î±_f â‰ˆ 0.017? | **DERIVED** (minimum bosonic step = 2/120) |
| L_f coherence scale? | **DERIVED** (L_f = v_cÂ²/aâ‚€) |
| Geometry factor Î¾? | **DERIVED** (â‰ˆ 0.46, profile-insensitive) |
| Discrete vs continuous? | **FALSIFIABLE** (histogram test) |
| RAR scatter from Î±_f? | OPEN |
| Threshold hierarchy (primes)? | EXPLORATORY |

## Surface Harmonics (Neutrino Masses)

Anti-periodic BC admits odd harmonics only: **(2m+1)** for m = 0, 1, 2, ...

Fundamental scale: Î¼_Î› â‰ˆ 2.25 meV (the source, not derived)

| m | Harmonic | Energy | Correspondence |
|---|----------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | 1st | ~7 meV | Solar Î½ â‰ˆ 8.6 meV |
| 3 | 7th | ~50 meV | Atmospheric Î½ â‰ˆ 50 meV |

**Selection rule (motivated):** Why 1st and 7th? The octave (7 notes, then return transformed). Resonance structure.

### Neutrino Splitting Scales (Pattern, Not Derivation)

| Observable | Measured | Ratio to Î¼_Î› | Nearest integer | Note |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|------|
| Î¼_Î› | 2.25 meV | 1 | â€” | Source scale |
| âˆš(Î”mÂ²â‚‚â‚) solar | 8.6 meV | 3.8 | ~4 | O(1) multiple |
| âˆš(Î”mÂ²â‚ƒâ‚) atmos | ~50 meV | 22.2 | ~21 (= Fâ‚ˆ?) | O(10) multiple |

**Observation:** Neutrino splitting scales are O(1) and O(10) multiples of Î¼_Î›. The ratios (~3.8, ~22) are *suggestive* of integer or Fibonacci structure.

**Status:** PATTERN observed. Exact relationship OPEN. Do not claim integers without derivation.

## Magic Numbers and the 120-Grid

| Magic # | Factorization | Grid relationship | Diagnosis |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 2 | 2Â¹ | â‰¤ 2Â³ | Pure consonance |
| 8 | 2Â³ | = 2Â³ | Pure consonance (saturated) |
| 20 | 2Â² Ã— 5 | â‰¤ 2Â³ Ã— 5Â¹ | Pure consonance |
| 28 | 2Â² Ã— **7** | Contains coprime 7 | Tension-stabilized |
| 50 | 2 Ã— **5Â²** | 5Â² exceeds 5Â¹ | Amplitude overflow |
| 82 | 2 Ã— **41** | Contains coprime 41 | Tension-stabilized |
| 126 | 2 Ã— 3Â² Ã— **7** | Contains coprime 7 | Tension-stabilized |

**Pattern:**
- Lower magic numbers (2, 8, 20): Pure consonance with 120
- Higher magic numbers (28, 82, 126): Stabilized by coprime tension (7, 41)
- The anomaly (50): Not coprime tension, **amplitude overflow** (5Â² exceeds grid capacity)

**Conjecture:** Nuclear stability has two regimes:
1. Light nuclei: Pure resonance with 2-3-5 grid
2. Heavy nuclei: Tension-stabilized by coprime "scaffolding"

**Status:** EXPLORING (needs nuclear physics derivation)

## Six Anomalies, One Geometry

| Foundation | Anomaly | Resolution |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Topology | CMB low-â„“ | Mode restriction from bounded domain |
| Topology | CMB axis alignment | Twist axis of non-orientable identification |
| Wave-matter | aâ‚€ â‰ˆ cHâ‚€ | Same wave, different phase wells |
| Surface | Î› â‰ˆ 10â»Â¹Â²Â² | Dimensional projection, not fine-tuning |
| Scale-dep. | Null DM | Bulk (n=3) inaccessible to surface detectors |
| Bounded | Î©_H â‰ˆ Î©_Î› | Observer at midpoint: matter requires access to both n=1 (edge) and n=2 (surface) modes |

---

## Pre-Realized vs Realized

**Critical ontological distinction:**

| Layer | Character | Î±_f? |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Topology | SÂ¹ = âˆ‚M â†ª SÂ³ | No (structure, just is) |
| The Waltz | âˆ‚M sampled twice â†’ Î¼_Î› | No (source, pre-observation) |
| 120-grid | Filter structure | No (categorical) |
| Î±â‚€ | Phase wells | No (geometric, fixed) |
| **Observation** | Someone samples from somewhere | **Yes (Î±_f enters here)** |

**The Waltz is pre-realized.** It produces Î¼_Î› exactly (in-model). Î±_f is not fundamental to the source; it's the cost of observing from a location.

**The Waltz is the music. Î±_f is the acoustics of the room you're listening in.**

---

## Notation Reference
