## The Core Claim

**What evolves is perspective, not Λ.**

The cosmic standing wave Ψ(t) = cos(t/2) imprints phase-dependent structure. Observers fitting fluid-based models recover varying w(z) not because Λ changes, but because the framework can't capture phase position.

## Locked Parameters

| Parameter | MIT Value | Falsified If |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Phase offset δ | −1.06 rad | (fixed) |
| Phantom crossing z_cross | 0.66 ± 0.12 | z_cross < 0.4 OR > 0.9 |
| w(z) curvature | d²w/dz² ≠ 0 | Linear CPL preferred at Δχ² > 4 |
| Physical Λ | Constant | Λ(z)/Λ(0) ≠ 1 at 2σ |
| w₀ (inferred) | −0.85 to −0.70 | Outside range |

## The Inversion

MIT predicts the **inverse** of standard assumptions:

| | Standard | MIT |
|-|----------|-----|
| Λ | May evolve | **Constant** |
| a₀ | Constant | **Evolves as H(z)** |

Both predictions are independently testable.

## w_eff(z) Inference Signature

$$w_{eff}(z) = -1 - \varepsilon \cdot \cos\left[\frac{2\pi + \delta}{2(1+z)}\right]$$

Where:
- ε ≈ 0.25 (amplitude, mid-band)
- δ = −1.06 rad (phase offset, locked)

w_eff is not a physical property of dark energy. It is what observers recover when fitting constant-Λ reality with evolving-w tools.

## Why "Team Cosine"?

DESI's evolving w(z) can be fit by:
- **Team Cosine:** Λ constant, phase-dependent sampling (MIT)
- **Team Linear:** Λ evolves, CPL parameterization (quintessence)

Euclid DR1 will distinguish them. The curvature test (d²w/dz² ≠ 0) favors Team Cosine if the oscillatory signature is present.

## Falsification Hierarchy

1. **z_cross outside [0.4, 0.9]** — Immediate falsification
2. **Linear CPL preferred at Δχ² > 4** — Strong falsification
3. **Λ(z)/Λ(0) ≠ 1 at 2σ** — Framework falsification
4. **w₀ outside [−0.85, −0.70]** — Tension (not fatal alone)
