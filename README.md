# Mode Identity Theory

$$\Large \boxed{S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset}$$

The temporal edge $S^1$ bounds the non-orientable Möbius surface, embedded in the closed hypersphere $S^3$, which has no boundary.

**One postulate. One scaling law:**

$$\Large \boxed{A/A_P = C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}}$$

$C(\Theta)$ is what $\Psi$ yields at phase position $\Theta$.

$(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ is the observer; the square root of scale, diluted by the manifold sampled.

Their product yields the modal realization, $A/A_P$ , the ratio of the observable amplitude over its Planck-scale reference. 

The constants of the universe follow across 122 orders of magnitude, and fermionic mass is realized through structure.

## Falsification

Two predictions separate this framework from alternatives: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ while Λ remains constant, and phantom crossing at $z \approx 0.66$ is inference artifact, not evolving vacuum energy. Falsification criteria are pre-registered.

**Judgment Day: October 21, 2026.**

**[Team Cosine: Euclid DR1 Predictions](https://dmobius3.github.io/mode-identity-theory/tools/euclid-dr1.html)**

Euclid's independent measurement will either end MIT, ΛCDM, or both. Full stop.
