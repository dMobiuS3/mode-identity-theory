# Mode Identity Theory

**One postulate. Everything else derives.**

$$S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset$$

## Preface

Standard physics sees matter as fundamental: particles exist, and they sometimes behave like waves. Mode Identity Theory inverts this. Waves exist, and the universe samples them. Particles are modal realizations of that return. This is not a philosophical preference; it determines which questions are well-formed.

Standard physics treats time as a background coordinate through which the universe evolves. Here, time didn't begin; it emerged as the boundary of our domain. "13.8 billion years" marks where we are on the standing wave Ψ, not how long we've been waiting.

Standard physics treats the observer as external to the system. This framework treats the observer as constitutive: the position where the ratio ∞/0 yields a defined number. The bounded domain at √Ω where the wave resolves to finite value.

While standard cosmology views space as uniformly three-dimensional, MIT sees effective dimension as scale-dependent: the horizon scales with 2D area, not with our local perception of 3D volume. The 122-order discrepancy of Λ is not a coincidentally large number, but the dimensional projection from where we stand.

Everything here traces to one topological postulate. The temporal edge S¹ bounds the non-orientable Möbius surface, embedded in the closed hypersphere S³, which has no boundary. The edge bounds the surface in space. One scaling law follows:

$$A/A_P \approx C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$$

It derives the constants of the universe across 122 orders of magnitude with zero free parameters. Topology holds. Wave is. Particle samples.

## Calculator

Run the scaling law and the mass formula yourself:

**[Interactive Calculator](https://dmobius3.github.io/mode-identity-theory/Calculator.html)**

Every output traces the topology through a locked derivation chain. No hidden knobs. No fitting. The code is the math.

## Falsification

Two predictions separate this framework from alternatives:

- **a₀(z) ∝ H(z)** while **Λ remains constant**
- **Phantom crossing** at **z ≈ 0.66** is inference artifact, not evolving vacuum energy

Falsification criteria are pre-registered: [Team Cosine (Euclid DR1)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18189078)

**Judgment Day: October 21, 2026.**

Euclid's independent measurement will either end MIT, ΛCDM, or both. Full stop.
