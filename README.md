# Mode Identity Theory

$$\Large \boxed{S^1 = \partial(\text{Möbius}) \hookrightarrow S^3, \quad \partial S^3 = \emptyset}$$

The temporal edge $S^1$ bounds the non-orientable Mobius surface, embedded in the closed hypersphere $S^3$, which has no boundary. One postulate. One scaling law:

$$\Large \boxed{A/A_P = C(\Theta) \cdot (\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}}$$

$C(\Theta)$ is where on the wave Ψ. $(\sqrt{\Omega})^{-n}$ is how far from Planck, on which manifold. 

The constants of the universe follow across 122 orders of magnitude with no free parameters. Fermionic mass is realized through the structure.

Standard physics sees matter as fundamental: particles exist, and they sometimes behave like waves. This framework inverts the premise: Waves exist, and the universe samples them. Particles are where the wave resolved when you looked. Time is the edge of the wave, not a container for events. The observer is the position $\sqrt{\Omega} \approx 10^{61}$ where the bounded domain resolves to finite value. The 122-order "discrepancy" of Λ is not a coincidentaly large number, is the dimensional projection from where we stand.

Everything derived traces to and from the flip.

## Falsification

Two predictions separate this framework from alternatives: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ while Λ remains constant, and phantom crossing at $z \approx 0.66$ is inference artifact, not evolving vacuum energy. Falsification criteria are pre-registered.

Euclid's independent measurement will either end MIT, ΛCDM, or both. Full stop.
