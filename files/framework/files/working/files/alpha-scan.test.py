alpha-scan.test.py -- RECONSTRUCTION / REGRESSION artifact for the alpha identifiability
scan reported in spectrum/files/fine-structure.md SS IV.  (PF3, 2026-09-01)

This reconstructs the CURRENTLY PUBLISHED enumeration from first principles. It does not
recover the historical script that originally produced it; no such script was found.

Why it exists: the corpus carried two irreconcilable enumerations for these scans, the
source page's 24 restricted / 7,200 broad and claim-ledger row 5's 47 restricted /
3,527 broad. The 93-770% miss range attached to the latter was separately shown to be
unattainable and withdrawn. This script settles which enumeration is reproducible.

Formula under test:  alpha = C(Theta) * Omega_Lambda**(-1/d),  C(Theta) = 2 sin^2(pi Theta)

Run:  python3 alpha-scan.test.py     (stdlib only; exits non-zero if any check fails)
