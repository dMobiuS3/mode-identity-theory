## Falsification

Two predictions separate this framework from alternatives: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ while Λ remains constant, and phantom crossing at $z \approx 0.66$ is inference artifact, not evolving vacuum energy. Falsification criteria are pre-registered.

Euclid's independent measurement will either end MIT, ΛCDM, or both. Full stop.
