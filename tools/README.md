## Tools

Run the postulate, trace the derivation, compute the outputs. Every link between topology and observable is live. The code is the math.

## Falsification

Two predictions separate this framework from alternatives: $a_0(z) \propto H(z)$ while Λ remains constant, and phantom crossing at $z \approx 0.66$ is inference artifact, not evolving vacuum energy. Falsification criteria are pre-registered.

Euclid's independent measurement will either end MIT, ΛCDM, or both. Full stop.
